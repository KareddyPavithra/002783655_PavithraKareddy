            I am interested in pursuing Information Systems because I believe it
            is a field that is constantly evolving and offers many opportunities
            for growth. As technology advances, so do the needs of businesses
            and organizations to keep up with the times. With an Information
            Systems degree, I can help bridge the gap between technology and
            business by understanding how to use technology to improve
            efficiency, productivity, and customer service. Additionally, I am
            passionate about finding ways to make data more accessible and
            useful for businesses. With an Information Systems degree, I can
            help develop systems that make data easier to understand and use for
            decision-making processes.

            I have always been interested in coding because it allows me to
            create and solve complex problems. I find the process of breaking
            down a problem into smaller pieces and then finding a solution to be
            incredibly satisfying. Additionally, coding is an ever-evolving
            field that requires constant learning, which I find exciting. I've
            done various certifications like Programming for Everybody using
            Python and Artificial Intelligence by Oracle Academy. I have learnt
            Java and C programming languages from my schooling. I have
            participated in various hackathons to get hands-on experience and
            improve my skills. I was a member of IEEE organization where I
            organized college expo and over 400 students participated in it. I
            also served as Membership Development Officer and learned Marketing
            skills.

            I chose to pursue my Masters in the US because I wanted to further
            my education and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
            The US is home to some of the world's best universities, and I felt
            that studying in this environment would give me access to
            cutting-edge research, top-notch faculty, and a diverse student
            body. Additionally, I wanted to experience living in a different
            country and culture, which would help me grow both personally and
            professionally.

            <h2>Java Netbeans</h2>
            <p>
              Designed and developed a Student Management System app, a one-stop
              solution for universities to manage all significant student
              activities. App includes modules to manage student enrollment,
              course registrations, grades, library, and transport facilities.

              Built Identification and Categorizing models using Python by
              analyzing text in IMDb reviews data set. Implemented Latent
              Dirichlet Allocation algorithm by building bigrams and trigrams
              followed by lemmatization to identify a movie genre based on
              reviews provided and determine cast of the movie.
